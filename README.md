## Architecture & Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: Flutter
-   **Database**: `drift` (a reactive persistence library for Dart and Flutter built on top of SQLite) for local data persistence.
-   **Core Plugins**:
    -   `receive_sharing_intent`: To capture links shared from other applications.
    -   `url_launcher`: To open saved links in the browser.
    -   `share_plus`: To share links from within the app.
    -   `flutter_slidable`: For intuitive swipe actions on list items.
    -   `awesome_snackbar_content`: For clean, informative in-app notifications.

## Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ models/       # Data models for Link and Category
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # All UI components, organized by screens and widgets
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/        # Utility functions for validation and category management
â””â”€â”€ main.dart     # Application entry point and shared intent handling
```
